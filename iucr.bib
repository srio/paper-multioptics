Conventional methods only consider the calculation from the perspective of discrete computation which would either cause error or sacrifice efficiency. In this work, we provide a unified frequency response analysis from the joint physics-mathematics perspective and propose corresponding adaptive frequency sampling strategies for five popular diffraction calculation methods. With the proposed strategies, the calculation correctness is guaranteed and the calculation efficiency is improved. Such an idea of unified frequency response study would help researchers make a do-it-yourself analysis for various diffraction calculation tasks and choose or develop a method for accurate and efficient computations of the diffraction fields.},

This challenge can be compounded by the presence of diffracting objects, as is often the case. Here, I give details of a method for robustly simulating the propagation of beams with divergent wavefronts in a coordinate system where the wavefronts become planar. I also show how diffracting objects can be simulated, while guaranteeing that correct sampling is maintained. These two advances allow for numerically efficient and accurate simulations of divergent beams propagating through diffracting structures using the multi-slice approximation. The sampling requirements and numerical implementation are discussed in detail, and I have made the computer code freely available.},

abstract = {We describe an approach to calculating the optical performance of a wide range of nanofocusing X-ray optics using multislice scalar wave propagation with a complex X-ray refractive index. This approach produces results indistinguishable from methods such as coupled wave theory, and it allows one to reproduce other X-ray optical phenomena such as grazing incidence reflectivity where the direction of energy flow is changed significantly. Just as finite element analysis methods allow engineers to compute the thermal and mechanical responses of arbitrary structures too complex to model by analytical approaches, multislice propagation can be used to understand the properties of the real-world optics of finite extent and with local imperfections, allowing one to better understand the limits to nanoscale X-ray imaging.},

               phase-space tomography is used, which requires only measurements
               of the x-ray intensity. We find that the field is statistically
               stationary to within experimental error, the correlations are
               very well approximated by a Gaussian distribution, and the
               measured coherence length is in excellent agreement with
